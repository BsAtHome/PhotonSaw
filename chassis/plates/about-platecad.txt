PlateCAD is a very simple CAD program which allows the user to create drawings of simple 2D plates.

A side effect of restricting the program to construction of only simple primitives is that they can be produced from plate stock, using only a bench drill and a hacksaw, whereas a proper CAD program would allow any arbitrary shape to be constructed.


The primitives available are:
* Rectangular plate size, optionally with rounded corners.
* Round hole location and diameter.
* Arbitrary paths consisting of straight lines.
* Informational marks.

Other than the plate itself the other features can be located in a separate file and reused in several plates.


The output is an Inkscape compatible SVG file containg several layers:
* Plate: Only the rectangular plate.
* Holes: The holes, as white circles of the appropriate size.
* Marks: crosses at each hole center and informational marks.
* Measurements: The x/y position of all marks along the edges of the plate.
* Annotations: All the paths.

The layers can be turned on and off in Inkscape to produce the needed work drawing or G-code for automated production.
