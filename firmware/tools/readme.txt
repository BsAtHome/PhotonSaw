This directory contains the script needed to build gcc, gdb, newlib and openocd
for use with the lpc1769 PhotonSaw board.

The fetch-lpc17xx-driver-library script will download the lpc17xx driver
library from NXP, which is a good place to get drivers from, but isn't
strictly needed to build the existing firmware.
